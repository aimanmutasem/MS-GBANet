# MS-GBANet

This repository hosts the initial public release of **MS-GBANet**, focused **on polyp segmentation** (training/testing) in colonoscopy images. The code is implemented in PyTorch and uses boundary-aware attention for accurate segmentation.

 ðŸ”œ **Coming soon:** implementations for additional datasets/modalities, ablation scripts, and pretrained weights.

 ## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/aimanmutasem/MS-GBANet.git
    cd MS-GBANe
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download or prepare the test datasets and place them in `./data/polyp/TestDataset/`.

## Usage

### Testing

To evaluate the model on the test datasets, run:

```sh
python test_polyp.py --model_path ./model_pth/Polyp_MSGBANET_img_size352bs4_Run1/Polyp_MSGBANET_img_size352bs4_Run1-best.pth
```
